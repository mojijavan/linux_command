The Boot Process
1-Motherboard Firmware does a PowerOnSelfTest
2-Motherboard loads the bootloader
3-Bootloader loads the Linux Kernel-based on its configs/commands
4-The Kernel loads and prepares the system (root filesystem) and runs the initialization program
5-Init program start the service, other programs, ... (web server, graphical interface, networking, etc.)

check using a UEFI system or not
> /sys/firmware/efi

unix bootloaders are Lilo and GRUB

kernel needs some initial info to start; Things like drivers are necessary to work with the hardware. 
Those are stored in initrd or initramfs alongside the kernel and used during the boot.

dmesg command will show the full data from kernel ring buffer up to now.
cat /var/log/dmesg

check Kernel logs
journalctl -k 
boot logs 


journalctl -b
kernel to see all previous logs too
journalctl -u

In addition to these, most systems keep the boot logs in a text-like file too. Under Debian-based systems, it's called /var/log/boot and for RedHat-based systems, it's /var/log/boot.log.

init
Kernel finished its initialization > time to start other programs > Kernel runs the Initialization Daemon process > and it takes care of starting other daemons, services, subsystems and programs.
Using the init system one can say "I need service A and then service B. Then I need C and D and E but do not start D unless the A and B are running". 
The system admin can use the init system to stop and start the services later.

There are different init systems:
SysVinit
systemd
upstart

The init process had the ID of 1 and you can find it by running the
> /sbin/init
> readlink -f /sbin/init
> ps -p 1

check the hierarchy of processes
> pstree

The systemd is made around units
> systemctl list-units
> systemctl list-units --type=target
> systemctl get-default

The units can be found in these places (sorted by priority):

> /etc/systemd/system/
> /run/systemd/system/
> /usr/lib/systemd/system

> systemctl list-unit-files
> systemctl cat ntpd.service
> systemctl cat graphical.target
> systemctl stop sshd
> systemctl start sshd
> systemctl status sshd
> systemctl is-active sshd
> systemctl is-failed sshd
> systemctl restart sshd
> systemctl reload sshd > re-reads the configuration of the service configs
> systemctl daemon-reload sshd > re-reads the configuration of the systemd configs of this service
> systemctl enable sshd
> systemctl disable sshd

> journalctl > show all journal
> journalctl --no-pager > do not use less
> journalctl -n 10 > only 10 lines
> journalctl -S -1d > last 1 day
> journalctl -xe > last few logs
> journalctl -u ntp > only ntp unit
> journalctl _PID=1234
