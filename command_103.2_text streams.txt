Modern programming environments and shells (including bash) use three standard I/O streams:

stdin is the standard input stream, which provides input to commands.
stdout is the standard output stream, which displays output from commands.
stderr is the standard error stream, which displays error output from commands



copy typed text to file
> cat > my data
moji,10
satar,20
bagher,40
#end file with ctrl+d

view 2 file Content after him
> cat mydata youdata
Some common cat switches are 
-n to show line numbers
-s to squeeze blanks
-T to show tabs
-v to show non-printing characters.

see the contents of compressed files without uncompressing them first
bzcat, xzcat, zcat, gzcat

show format other than text - like octalDump
> od mydata

Will split the files.
> split -n 5 mydata output
Need to join these files? cat them with 
> cat output* > mydata.

Will show the beginning (head) or end (tail) of text files. 
tail -f follows the new lines which are being written at the end of the file. Very useful.

The cut command will cut one or more columns from a file. Good for separating fields

sort & uniq
If you want a reverse sort, use the -r switch.
If you want to sort NUMERICALLY (so 9 is lower than 19), use -n.
> sort howcool.txt uses.txt

uniq removes duplicate entries from its input
> uniq what_i_have.txt
> sort what_i_have.txt | uniq
> sort what_i_have.txt  | uniq -c  #show count of each item
> sort what_i_have.txt  | uniq -u #show only non-repeated items
> sort what_i_have.txt  | uniq -d #show only repeated items

The paste command pastes lines from two or more files side-by-side!
> paste howcool uses

The tr command translates characters in the stream
> cat mydata | tr 'and' 'AND'

sed is stream editor.
> sed 's/ubuntu/debian/' uses #change first item in line
> sed 's/A/B/g' #change all item in line

The wc is word count
It is very common to count the line numbers with -l switch.
> wc -l mydata

for replace use > charector
>echo "hi ali" > text.txt
for append to end of file use >> charector

redirecting STDERROR
show ls root and error for /ggg
ls / /ggg
no showing error. send error to /dev/null
ls / /ggg 2>/dev/null
show error in bash
ls / /ggg 1>/dev/null

The comm command66 compares two text files, displaying the lines that are unique to each one
>comm scan-a.txt scan-b.txt

The diff command67 is used to detect differences between files, similar to the comm command.
However, diff is much more complex and supports many output formats
context format (-c) and the unified format (-u).
> diff -c scan-a.txt scan-b.txt

vimdiff opens vim68 with multiple files, one in each window. The differences between files are
highlighted, which makes it easier to visually inspect them.
>vimdiff scan-a.txt scan-b.txt

Hashing
md5sum
sha256sum
sha512sum
> md5sum /tmp/myfile.txt
