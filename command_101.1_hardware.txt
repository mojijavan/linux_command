sysfs is a pseudo file . inormation about various kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and associated device drivers from the kernel's device model to user space through virtual files
> ls /sys

udev (userspace /dev) is a device manager for the Linux kernel
ls /dev

hard detail
>ls /dev/sda or /dev/nvme0

D-Bus is a message bus system

This is where the Kernel keeps its settings and properties.
You can find things like:
IRQs (interrupt requests)
I/O ports (locations in memory where CPU can talk with devices)
DMA (direct memory access, faster than I/O ports)
Processes
Network Settings
> ls /proc

The numbers are the process IDs! There are also other files like cpuinfo, mounts, meminfo
> cat /proc/cpuinfo

lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw

Just like ls but for pci, usb, ...

lspci
Shows PCI devices that are connected to the computer.

lsusb
Shows all the USB devices connected to the system.

lshw
Shows hardware. Test it!

lsblk
Used for list devices that can read from or write to by blocks of data.

lsmod
Shows kernel modules. They are located at /lib/modules.

These are the kernel modules that are loaded. Use modinfo to get more info about a module; If you want.

If you need to add a module to your kernel (say a new driver for hardware) or remove it (uninstall a driver) you can use rmmod and modprobe.
# rmmod iwlwifi

And this is for installing the modules:
# insmod kernel/drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi.ko

But nobody uses insmod because it does not understand dependencies and you need to give it the whole path to the module file. Instead, use the modprobe command:
# modprobe iwlwifi
