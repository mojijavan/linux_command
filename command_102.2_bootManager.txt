Most systems use BIOS or UEFI

in BIOS > first firmware called POST > load MBR and doing some work > load main bootloader(Lilo or Grub)
> Grub doing its work and load init > init(systemd sysV) load anything needed 

in UEFI > hardware follow UEFI Stages > after load final stages > load partition with FAT32 contains PE File

GRUB
It's a menu-based system where you can choose which Kernel or chainloader to boot.
It is also possible to edit the menus on the fly or give direct commands from a command line.

Grub main configuration
> /boot/grub
> /boot/grub>menu.list
> /boot/grub/grub.conf

After creating the configuration, you need to install the grub on a disk MBR.
> grub-install /dev/fd0
> grub-install '(fd0)'

menuentry	Defines a new menuentry
set root	Defines the root where /boot located
linux, linux16	Defines the location of the Linux kernel on BIOS systems
linuxefi	Defines the Linux kernel on UEFI systems
initrd	Defines the initramfs image for BIOS systems
initrdefi	Defines the initramfs image for UEFI systems

Grub2
> /boot/grub2/
> /etc/default>grub #Grub2 Some Config
> /boot/efi/EFI/distro-name/
> /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/
grub.cfg

Grub2 Commands
The installation is done with 
> grub-install /dev/sda
after changing the config files, you need to issue 
grub2-mkconfig or grub-mkconfig.
> grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
> grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Interacting with GRUB2
If you press c on the grub menu, you will go into the GRUB Command Line or GRUB shell.
 There you can type commands like root and kernel and initrd and boot the system with boot 
or press the Esc key to return back to the menu.

change linux kernel in grub
change initrd in grub
after change grub fie in
> vim /etc/default/grub
#GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=HIDDEN
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
> grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg
> reboot
perss c
grub > ls (hd0,gpt3)/boot/
grub > linux (hd0,gpt3)/boot/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/sda1
grub > initrd (hd0,gpt3)/boot/initrdimg
