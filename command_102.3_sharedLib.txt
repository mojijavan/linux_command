Static Linking is when you add this library to your executable program
Dynamic Linking is when you just say in your program "We need this and that library to run this program"

Libraries related to system utilities are installed in
> /lib
> /lib64
libraries installed by other software will be located at 
> /usr/lib
> /usr/lib64

The ldd command helps you find:
If a program is dynamically or statically linked
What libraries a program needs
> ldd /sbin/ldconfig
> ldd /bin/ls

Symbolic links for libraries. use for link to updated library dynamically
> locate libudev.so.1
> ls -la /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1

Dynamic library configs and cache
> cat /etc/ld.so.conf
> ls /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
> ldconfig -p | head

Where OS finds dynamic libraries
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
Programs PATH
/etc/ld.so.conf (Which might load more files from /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ in its beginning or its end)
/lib/, /lib64/, /usr/lib/, /usr/lib64/

Loading dynamically
In the last part of this section, 
let's see how we can manually tell Linux to run a program using its dynamic linker. 
> locate ld-linux
> /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/bin/ls
> readelf -Wl /usr/bin/ls
